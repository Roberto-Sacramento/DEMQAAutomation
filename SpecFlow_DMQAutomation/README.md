To configure Selenium WebDriver with ChromeDriver in an automation framework using Visual Studio, C#, and SpecFlow, you typically need the following classes:

Hooks Class: For setup and teardown methods (e.g., initializing and quitting WebDriver).

Page Objects Classes: For defining the web elements and actions on various web pages (optional but recommended for better maintainability).

Step Definitions Class: For defining the step definitions corresponding to the Gherkin scenarios.

Test Runner Class: Automatically generated by SpecFlow to run your tests.
